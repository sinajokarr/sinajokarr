## 📈 Quantifiable Engineering Achievements (The Highlights)

A look at my approach to building robust, high-performance backends.

* ⚡ **Performance:** Proactively **removed N+1 query patterns** across critical data paths using `select_related`/`prefetch_related` for optimized resource usage.
* 🔒 **Security:** Implemented robust JWT authentication coupled with fine-grained **role and object-level permissions** (RBAC/ABAC) to enforce strict data access control.
* 🚀 **Optimization:** Engineered API response efficiency through **`ETag`/`304` caching**, sensible pagination, and rate throttling, significantly reducing server load.
* ✅ **Quality:** Enforced a **CI-first mindset**, achieving high code coverage and maintaining strict linting standards for code quality assurance.
* 📐 **Architecture:** Designed clean, maintainable APIs using Structured ViewSets/Routers and prioritized **type-hinted serializers** for enhanced code readability and stability.

## 💻 The Project Portfolio: Impact-Driven Case Studies

Showcasing technical problem-solving through results-focused project narratives.

### 🏠 **1. Real-Estate Platform (Django + DRF)**

* **Problem:** Slow property reads and security risks due to non-optimized database access.
* **Solution:** Implemented indexed slugs, heavily optimized ORM queries (`select/prefetch`), efficient ViewSets, and robust Token/JWT authentication.
* **Impact:** **Significantly fewer DB round-trips** (reduced latency) and a cleaner, high-speed API ready for SPA/mobile consumption.
* **Repo:** [View Project](https://github.com/sinajokarr/django-realestate-platform)

### 🛒 **2. Store API (E-commerce Backend)**

* **Problem:** Inconsistent latency when processing complex data involving products, discounts, and cart operations.
* **Solution:** Leveraged powerful PostgreSQL features with **Annotated Queries**, Subqueries, ETag/304, and strictly validated serializers.
* **Impact:** **Stable and predictable performance** under variable load with clear, reliable API contracts.

### 🗒️ **3. Notes API (SaaS Utility)**

* **Problem:** Requirement for secure, isolated storage of personal notes for multiple users.
* **Solution:** Implemented Simple JWT, enforced per-user querysets for strong data isolation, along with pagination, throttling, and a comprehensive `pytest` suite.
* **Impact:** **Solid, secure, and tested template** for future small SaaS utilities, minimizing future development risks.
