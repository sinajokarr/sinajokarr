## 📈 Quantifiable Engineering Achievements (The Highlights)

Focusing on technical impact and measurable results rather than just features.

* ⚡ **Performance:** Proactively **removed N+1 query patterns** across critical data paths using `select_related`/`prefetch_related` for optimized resource usage.
* 🔒 **Security:** **Implemented robust JWT authentication** coupled with fine-grained **role and object-level permissions** (RBAC/ABAC) to enforce strict data access control.
* 🚀 **Optimization:** Engineered API response efficiency through **`ETag`/`304` caching**, sensible pagination, and rate throttling, significantly reducing server load.
* ✅ **Quality:** Enforced a **CI-first mindset**, ensuring high code coverage and maintaining strict linting standards across all services.
* 📐 **Architecture:** Designed clean, maintainable APIs using Structured ViewSets/Routers and prioritized **type-hinted serializers** for enhanced code readability and stability.

## 💻 The Project Portfolio: Impact-Driven Case Studies

A look into specific projects and how complex technical challenges were solved to deliver superior results.

### 🏠 **1. Real-Estate Platform (Django + DRF)**

| **Context** | **Technical Solution** | **Impact & Result** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Problem:* Slow property reads and security vulnerabilities due to non-optimized database access and insufficient authentication. | *Solution:* Implemented indexed slugs, heavily optimized ORM queries (`select/prefetch`), efficient ViewSets, and robust Token/JWT authentication. | *Result:* **Significantly fewer DB round-trips** (reduced latency) and a cleaner, high-speed API ready for SPA/mobile consumption. |
| **[View Project](https://github.com/sinajokarr/django-realestate-platform)** |

### 🛒 **2. Store API (E-commerce Backend)**

| **Context** | **Technical Solution** | **Impact & Result** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Problem:* Inconsistent latency when processing complex data involving products, discounts, and cart operations. | *Solution:* Leveraged powerful PostgreSQL features with **Annotated Queries**, Subqueries, ETag/304, and strictly validated serializers. | *Result:* **Stable and predictable performance** under variable load with clear, reliable API contracts, boosting user confidence. |
| **[View Repository** (Placeholder) **]** |

### 🗒️ **3. Notes API (SaaS Utility)**

| **Context** | **Technical Solution** | **Impact & Result** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Problem:* Requirement for secure, isolated storage of personal notes for multiple users. | *Solution:* Implemented Simple JWT, enforced per-user querysets for strong data isolation, along with pagination, throttling, and a comprehensive `pytest` suite. | *Result:* **Solid, secure, and tested template** for future small SaaS utilities, minimizing future development risks. |
